## üîç Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Food Order Cost and Profit Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankulsharma150/food-order-cost-and-profit-analysis)
- **Records:** 1,000 rows  
- **Columns:** Order details, costs, discounts, payment methods, etc.

---

## üìå Key Findings

- High discounts do not always correlate with customer retention.
- Certain order types consistently underperform in terms of profitability.
- Commission fees can be optimized without significantly affecting partner revenue.
- Payment methods affect the likelihood of repeated orders.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Limited Dataset Size**: Only 1,000 records ‚Äî not enough for strong generalization.
- **No External Data**: Lacks inputs like seasonality, marketing campaigns, or economic conditions.
- **No Service Quality Metrics**: No data on customer satisfaction or delivery speed.

---

## üî≠ Future Work

- Add more data to improve statistical confidence.
- Include external factors (weather, promo campaigns, etc.).
- Analyze over longer periods to catch time trends.
- Add service quality and customer satisfaction metrics.
